### Migration Guide

#### For Developers
If you're upgrading from v1.x, please note that this is a complete rewrite. The component APIs, state management, and build system have all changed. We recommend:

1. Review the new component architecture in the `/src/components` directory
2. Understand the new state management with React Query and Zustand
3. Update any custom integrations to use the new TypeScript interfaces
4. Test thoroughly as all interfaces have changed

#### For Users
The application maintains the same core functionality while providing:
- Faster loading times
- Better search results
- Improved mobile experience
- More reliable performance
- Enhanced accessibility

### Known Issues
- Dark mode implementation is planned for v2.1.0
- Offline functionality is in development
- User authentication system is planned for v2.2.0
